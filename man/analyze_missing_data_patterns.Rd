\title{Analyze Missing Data with Optional Class Analysis}
\usage{
analyze_missing_data_patterns(data, class_col, sort_order = "none")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe representing the dataset.}

\item{class_col}{Optionally, the name of the column representing the class or target variable.
If NULL, the function will only calculate the proportion of missing data for each predictor.
Defaults to NULL.}

\item{sort_by}{Determines how the results should be sorted.
"none": No sorting (default).
"proportion": Sort by the proportion of missing data.
"class": Sort by the count of missing data occurrences within each class, applicable only if class_col is provided.}
}
\value{
Depending on the input parameters, the function returns either:
        - A named vector with predictors as names and proportions of missing data as values (default),
        - Or, if class_col is specified, a list containing both the proportions of missing data and the
          analysis of missing data by class. The results can be sorted based on the sort_by parameter.
}
\description{
This function calculates the proportion of missing data for each predictor in the dataset.
Optionally, if a class column is specified, it also examines the pattern of missing data in relation
to the classes of the dataset. It can return results sorted by the proportion of missing data or,
for class-specific analysis, by the count of missing occurrences within each class.
}
\examples{
data("Soybean", package = "mlbench")
# Basic usage without class analysis
missing_proportions <- analyze_missing_data(Soybean)
print(missing_proportions)

# With class analysis, no sorting
missing_analysis <- analyze_missing_data(Soybean, class_col = "Class")
print(missing_analysis)

# With class analysis, sorted by missing data proportion
missing_analysis_sorted <- analyze_missing_data(Soybean, class_col = "Class", sort_by = "proportion")
print(missing_analysis_sorted)

# Note: Sorting by class count is only meaningful if class_col is provided
# missing_analysis_class_sorted <- analyze_missing_data(Soybean, class_col = "Class", sort_by = "class")
# print(missing_analysis_class_sorted)
}
